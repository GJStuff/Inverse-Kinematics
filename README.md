# Inverse-Kinematics
Project I made in my web dev class in 10th grade.

I made this to pass the time when I had all my work finished. It features the ability to change how the amount and length of arm segments. My inspiration came from a youtube video showing an animation of the step by step process of an inverse kinematics algorithm in slow motion. With this algorithm I saw some interesting patterns emerge when you add many arm segments.
